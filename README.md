# Body-detection
## A compilation of codes aimed at detecting body parts

There are many techniches to locate body parts on an image or video.
This repository contains two examples, one using haarcascade and the other
using the mediapipe packege. This repository doesn't contain any structured 
project and its aim is to be used as a study material and reference base for
future projects with many useful codes that can be adapted to specific use cases

To test the scripts yourself just clone the repo and run the codes. Make sure you 
have a webcam available. Also if you want more options for the haarcascade you can 
go to https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades and download 
the xml files. Each diferent file only requires small changes on the code to run
